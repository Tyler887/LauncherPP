# Launcher++
Another Launcher for Android.

Git repo named `LauncherPP` because + is not allowed in Git repo names, the 2 P letters stand for "plus".

## Installation

Launcher++ is **not available on Google Play due to Google restrictions**.

You *can* still get it from [the CPPM package manager](https://github.com/Tyler887/CPPM#readme) and build the releases
using Gradle or Maven. Maven is not well supported, so I recommend Gradle.

## License

Launcher++ is [free software](https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) under the [Apache
license](./LICENSE).
